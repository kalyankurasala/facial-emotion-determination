## Quick Start
This section shows you how to prepare, build, and run the sample application.

1. Create a developer account at [agora.io](https://dashboard.agora.io/signin/). Once you finish the signup process, you will be redirected to the Dashboard.
2. Navigate in the Dashboard tree on the left to **Projects** > **Project List**.
3. Copy the App ID that you obtained from the Dashboard into a text file. You will need this to use the Agora platform.

### Run the Sample Sentiment Analysis model 

1. Open the `Server` directory and install the Python requirements through the terminal command.
```python
    pip install -r requirements.txt
```
2. After install the requirements, run the server using
```python
    python server.py
```
3. Keep the server running.

### Update and Run the Sample Application 

1. Open the [script.js](scripts/script.js) file under the `scripts` directory in a code editor.
2. Under Client Setup replace the `APP_ID` with the App Id obtained from the dashboard.

	**Before**

	``` JavaScript
	client.init("APP_ID",() => console.log("...") ,handleFail);
	```

	**After**

	``` JavaScript
	client.init("76db51...e40d15a3",() => console.log("...") ,handleFail);
	```
3. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser and allow access to Camera and Microphone for Audio and Video transmission.
4. For a demo, open the same file in an `new tab`, this creates the `remote stream` that is displayed on the Canvas and run through the sentiment analysis model.
